## Why?
I needed a convenient way to quickly run JavaScript code without having to open VSCode or a terminal. Other alternatives I found were either too bloated with a heavy focus on HTML and CSS, or too basic with unreliable logging. So, I decided to build my own JavaScript console using the same editor that VSCode uses, which provides a lot of handy features right out of the box.
