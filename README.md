## Try it out
Try out the console [here](https://console.sonnyt.com).

## Why?
I needed a convenient way to quickly run JavaScript code without having to open VSCode or a terminal. Other alternatives I found were either too bloated with a heavy focus on HTML and CSS, or too basic with unreliable logging. So, I decided to build my own JavaScript console using the same editor that VSCode uses, which provides a lot of handy features right out of the box.

## Features
- TypeScript support
- Code completion
- Decent logging capabilities
- Lightweight and user-friendly
- Localstorage support for data persistence
- Powered by [Monaco](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) editor for a rich editing experience

## Shortcuts
- `CMD/CTRL+ENTER` - Runs the code.
- `CMD/CTRL+K` - Clears the logs.
